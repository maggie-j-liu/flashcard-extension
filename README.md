# Flush

Flush is a chrome extension that will promote productivity and focus! By blocking distraction-causing websites and regularly prompting you with flashcards, Flush ensures that your studying is not compromised. Via an options page, you may mark which websites you would like to block and customize the time between prompts (flashcards). When you get one question (flashcard) correct, you are allowed to visit the site for a time that you set (e.g., 5 minutes) before you have to answer another flashcard. Regardless of if you are a student, employee, or parent, Flush will allow you to keep yourself on track to fulfilling your goals and reaping success!
